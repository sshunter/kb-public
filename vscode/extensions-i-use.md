# Extensions I Use

- ESLint
- Lua (for WoW addon, probably not normally needed)
- Markdown All in One
- markdownlint
- Rewrap
- shift shift
- Supermaven (experimenting with this instead of usual tabnine)

I also have my home grown [daily-diary-extension](./diary-extension.md) which,
for now,  is built and installed locally.
