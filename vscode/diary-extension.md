# Diary Extension

I wrote a quick diary extension for vscode that will open today's diary's
markdown file.

`Open Diary Entry` in the command pallette.

- Code currently lives at
  ~\work\vs-code-daily-diary-extension\daily-diary-extension on my windows pc
  but this will change when I clean it up.
- To install the extension from disk, use `Developer: Install Extension from
  Location...` in the command palette.


## Future enhancements

- check things in
- a command to open yesterday's diary entry, since my workflow in the morning is
to just roll everything in progress into the new file and I want to keep doing
that manually. 
- a command to open the diary's parent directory
- a configuration option for the diary's parent directory IF I PUBLISH
- a configuration option for the diary's file name format IF I PUBLISH
