# Install

I followed [Flutter's
docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows/mobile) more or less
as written, but...  
Don't install HAXM, it's deprecated and can be an adventure to uninstall (see
<https://github.com/intel/haxm/wiki/Installation-Instructions-on-Windows#removing-intel-haxm>).
I had to track down my bitlocker key by the time I had removed haxm and
re-enabled hyper.
