# Creating a Debian Install USB

1. Download from the latest netinst ISO  https://www.debian.org/download 
2. I used [Rufus](https://rufus.ie) to write the USB drive from Windows 11 
   - Set the Partition Scheme options to GPT
   - after clicking `Start`, when prompted, choose Write in DD Image mode
       - I am not 100% sure this is required but it should more closely match
       what the linux command line creation docs say
