# Cleanup Constraint Clutter - FreeCAD

The "Switch Virtual Space" tool along with filters can be used to clean up
constraint clutter in FreeCAD. Constraint filters can be used to determine which
constraints are shown for a given view, so you can group them together
logically.

This is something I need to experiment with more to make more meaningful notes.
