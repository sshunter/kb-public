# Kitty Litter vs. Indicating Dessicant

A little science to see if the indicating dessicant I purchased from Amazon is
worth the cost over the silica gel kitty litter I bought years ago and recently
redried. Worth means usefulness as a dessicant for my 3d filaments.

*Update* Based on these results I use proper dessicant for storage. I have been
using the silica gel kitty litter when annealing prints (as a substitute for
sand) successfully. I would use the kitty litter for dessicant in a pinch, but
as a stop gap to get the "good stuff".

## Overview

I have 2 containers of the indicating dessicant and 2 containers of the kitty
litter. 1 set were measured by volume to 1/4 cup and 1 set were measured by
weight (30 grams).

The indicating dessicant is more dense than the kitty litter. Note that I didn't
pre-dry the indicating dessicant, that might be a factor, but it hasn't changed
color so it should be good.

This experiment is less about the hard numbers, but more about seeing if the
kitty litter is acceptable. By weight, it was about 1/4 the cost (using cost
today not when I bought it) but if it doesn't absorb enough or becomes saturated
too quickly, it's still not a great dessicant.
