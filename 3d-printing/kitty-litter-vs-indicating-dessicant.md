# Kitty Litter vs. Indicating Dessicant

A little science to see if the indicating dessicant I purchased from Amazon is worth the cost over the silica gel kitty litter I bought years ago and recently redried. Worth means usefulness as a dessicant for my 3d filaments.

## Overview

I have 2 containers of the indicating dessicant and 2 containers of the kitty
litter. 1 set were measured by volume to 1/4 cup and 1 set were measured by
weight (30 grams).

The indicating dessicant is more dense than the kitty litter. Note that I didn't
pre-dry the indicating dessicant, that might be a factor, but it hasn't changed
color so it should be good.
