# KB Tags

To use tags or labels to organize your notes in a GitHub repository, you can follow these steps:

1. **Decide on your tagging system:** Determine which tags or labels you want to use to categorize your notes. For example, if you're taking notes on a programming language, you might use tags like `variables`, `functions`, `loops`, etc.

2. **Add tags or labels to your notes:** In each markdown file, add a section at the bottom of the file where you can add tags or labels. You can use GitHub-flavored markdown to create a section like this:

```
## Tags

- #programming
- #python
- #functions
```

3. **Search and filter your notes:** Once you have added tags to your notes, you can use GitHub's search and filter features to find specific notes or groups of notes. For example, you can search for all notes with the tag `#python`, or filter notes by multiple tags like `#programming` and `#functions`.

4. **Create a table of contents file:** You can also create a separate file that serves as a table of contents for your notes. In this file, you can list all of the tags or labels you are using and link to the notes that have each tag. This makes it easy to browse your notes by topic or tag.

Using tags or labels can make it easier to find and organize your notes, especially if you have a large number of notes in your repository. It can also make it easier to collaborate with others, as they can quickly find notes on a specific topic by searching for tags or labels.
