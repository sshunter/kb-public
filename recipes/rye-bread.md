# Rye Bread

Here's a recipe for a 1 1/2 lb loaf of rye bread that can be made in a bread
machine:

## Ingredients:

- 1 1/8 cups water
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 2 tablespoons molasses
- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
- 2 cups bread flour
- 1 cup rye flour
- 2 teaspoons active dry yeast

## Instructions:

1. Add all the ingredients to the bread machine pan in the order listed.
2. Select the "basic" or "whole wheat" cycle, depending on your bread machine.
3. Set the crust color to your desired preference.
4. Start the machine and let it run through the entire cycle.
5. Once the cycle is complete, remove the bread from the machine and let it cool
   on a wire rack before slicing.

## Notes:

This recipe should yield a flavorful and hearty loaf of rye bread that can be
enjoyed for sandwiches, toast, or simply on its own.

First attempt I am using 2 tbs honey instead of molasses. Honey is sweeter than
molassess so this might need to be re-used.

First attampt I am using the "whole wheat" cycle "because rye flour is denser
than wheat flour and requires a longer kneading time and shorter rising time to
achieve a good rise and texture."
