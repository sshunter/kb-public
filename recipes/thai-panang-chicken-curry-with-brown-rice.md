## Instructions

1. **Start the rice:** Rinse 1 cup brown rice under cold water. In a medium pot, combine rice with 2¼ cups water and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 45 minutes until tender and water is absorbed.

2. **Prepare the chicken:** While rice cooks, cut the 2 chicken thighs into 1-inch bite-sized pieces. Pat dry with paper towels and season lightly with salt and pepper.

3. **Cook the chicken:** Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add chicken pieces and cook 5-6 minutes, stirring occasionally, until browned and cooked through (internal temp 165°F).

4. **Add vegetables:** Add the frozen pacific blend vegetables to the skillet with the chicken. Stir-fry for 3-4 minutes until vegetables are heated through and starting to soften.

5. **Create the curry:** Pour in the Panang curry simmer sauce and coconut milk. Add 1 tablespoon soy sauce. Stir well to combine. Bring to a gentle simmer.

6. **Simmer:** Reduce heat to medium-low and let the curry simmer for 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens slightly and vegetables are tender.

7. **Serve:** Fluff the cooked rice with a fork. Divide rice between 2 bowls and top generously with the chicken curry.
