# Instant Pot Spaghetti

<https://thekitchengirl.com/instant-pot-spaghetti/>

## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon Olive Oil
- ½ Onion diced (about 1 cup)
- 3 cloves Garlic minced
- 1 pound Lean Ground Beef (uncooked) or ground turkey
- 1 tablespoon Dried Oregano optional
- ½ teaspoon Italian Seasoning optional
- ½ teaspoon Sea Salt optional
- ¼ teaspoon Black Pepper optional
- 1 pound Uncooked Spaghetti Noodles (standard size) use ¾ pound for saucier pasta
- 1 (24-ounce) Pasta Sauce or 3 cups homemade tomato sauce
- 4 cups Water or broth

## Instructions

1. Select "Saute" and heat OLIVE OIL until Instant Pot display reads "Hot".
2. Add ONIONS, GARLIC, GROUND BEEF, OREGANO, ITALIAN SEASONING, SALT, and PEPPER. Saute until beef is cooked through, stirring as needed. Drain any excess fat, if needed.
3. Deglaze the pot by adding a few splashes of WATER (or broth). Use a flat-end utensil to scrape and loosen any browned bits stuck to the bottom (these are flavor gold). Select “Cancel” to stop the saute cycle.
4. Break and scatter the SPAGHETTI NOODLES over the cooked beef in a criss-cross pattern.
5. Add WATER to the pot. Pour PASTA SAUCE directly on the spaghetti noodles and spread in an even layer. Press the spaghetti under the liquid to submerge.
6. Close and lock the lid and set the pressure release valve to “Sealing”. Select “Manual” or “Pressure cook” on HIGH 2 minutes (for al dente spaghetti) or 3 minutes (for softer). YES, YOU HEARD THAT RIGHT ... 2 or 3 minutes ... the spaghetti continues cooking in the next step (and we also don't like mushy noodles).
7. At the end of the cook cycle, allow the pot to sit undisturbed for a 10-minute natural pressure release (NPR). DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP...the spaghetti is still cooking.
8. Release any remaining steam, open lid, stir ingredients until well combined. Serve warm.
Note: When you first open the lid after noodles cook, there will likely be a small amount of excess liquid. Just stir it into the pasta and it will get absorbed in minutes.
9. To store, allow spaghetti to cool completely and refrigerate in airtight containers up to 5 days.

## Notes

**Reheating leftovers** - To reheat spaghetti leftovers, add splashes of cooking liquid during reheat because the starch continually absorbs moisture.
