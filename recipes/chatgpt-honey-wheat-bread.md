   bread machine manufacturer.

I asked ChatGPT for a Honey Wheat Bread recipe. Then followed up with "do you
remember the honey wheat bread recipe? Can you give me one that uses half wheat
flour and half unbleached white flour?" 

It gave me instructions to make it by kneading and oven baking so I asked it if
I could make it in the bread machine unchanged and it gave me the 3 step
instructions.

## Comments:

The dough looked a little dry, but this baked much better in my bread machine.
It does use 4 cups vs 3 with the O.G. recipe, so its possible I was baking the
latter too long, but I think something else was going on. Anyway, it tastes much
the same.

- I think it worked better using 2 cups whole wheat, 1.5 cups all-purpose flour.
  The moisture mix was better, it was lighter and still rose to the same height
  as before.  
  I want to try again using 2 cups all purpose, 1.5 cups whole what and then do
  2 cups / 1.75 cups ratio for whichever of those two I like better.
