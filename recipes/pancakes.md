## Ingredients

- 1 egg
- 3/4 cup milk

- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 3 teaspoons baking powder

## Cooking Instructions

1. Beat egg until fluffy.
2. Add milk and melted margarine.
3. Add dry ingredients and mix well.
4. Heat a heavy griddle or frying pan (greased with a little butter on a paper
   towel). The pan is hot enough when a drop of water breakes into several
   smaller balls which 'dance' around the pan.
5. Pour a small amount of batter (approx 1/4 cup) into pan and tip to spread out
   (or spread with spoon).
6. When bubbles appear on top surface and begin to break, turn over and cook the
   other side.
