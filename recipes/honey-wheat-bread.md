# Honey Wheat Bread Recipe

Here's a recipe for a honey wheat bread using half whole wheat flour and half
unbleached all-purpose flour:

Note: This is a 2lb loaf

## Ingredients

- 1 1/8 cup warm water (110 degrees F)
- 1/3 cup honey
- 1/4 cup vegetable oil
- 2 tsp active dry yeast
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 cups whole wheat flour
- 1 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour (have used bleached/white all-purpose
  in the past as well)
- 1 tbs vital wheat gluten (I added this: 1tbs per 2 cups of **whole** wheat)

## Instructions

1. Add the ingredients to your bread machine pan in the order specified by your
   bread machine manufacturer.
   - Put salt in as the first of the dry ingredients, so it starts to dissolve
     in liquids as you add the rest.
2. Select the whole wheat and 2 lb loaf settings, and the desired crust color
   (light, medium, or dark).
3. Press start and let the bread machine do the work!
4. **Optional:** As soon as it finishes, rub a little oil on top to soften the
   crust.
5. Wait 10 minutes and then transfer load to a wire rack. If the paddle is stuck
   in the bottom, extract it now. Cover with clean cloth or paper towels and
   wait 20 more minutes before serving.

I found the core recipe online but have lost the link. It had some problems so I
have been experimenting with it.

## Comments

- Original recipe was 1 cup water but I've ended up adding a little as it mixes.
  1 1/8 seems to work right every time. It was also 2 cups whole wheat and 2
  cups all-purpose, but I cut the all-purpose as part of experimenting with results.
- Reduced the vital wheat gluten and yeast based on feedback from duck.ai's
  gpt-5 mini. First loaf is very promising. If it's repeatable, we're done here.
