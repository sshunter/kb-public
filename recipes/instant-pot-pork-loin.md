Another ChatGPT recipe

## Ingredients:

- 3 lb pork loin
- 4-5 medium russet potatoes, cut into chunks
- 1 large red onion, sliced
- 1 cup chicken broth
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp dried thyme (I used 2tsp instead of thyme and rosemary)
- 1 tsp dried rosemary
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 2 tbsp olive oil

## Instructions:

1. Turn on the Instant Pot and set it to "Saute" mode. Heat 2 tbsp of olive oil
   in the pot.
2. Season the pork loin with garlic powder, dried thyme, dried rosemary, salt,
   and black pepper. Sear the pork loin on all sides until browned.
3. Remove the pork loin from the Instant Pot and set it aside.
4. Add sliced onions to the Instant Pot and saute until they are softened and
   translucent.
5. Add the chicken broth to the Instant Pot and scrape the bottom of the pot to
   deglaze it.
6. Add the pork loin back to the Instant Pot and arrange the potato chunks
   around it.
7. Close the Instant Pot lid and set the valve to "Sealing" position. Set the
   [Instant](Instant) Pot to "Manual" or "Pressure Cook" mode for 60 minutes.
8. Once the cooking time is over, allow the pressure to release naturally for
   10-15 minutes, then use the quick release method to release any remaining
   pressure.
9. Open the Instant Pot and remove the pork loin, potatoes, and onions onto a
   serving platter.
10. Let the pork loin rest for 5-10 minutes before slicing and serving.
