# Cast Iron Cornbread

Servings: 8
Preparation Time: 45 minutes (20 minutes prep)

The cast iron pan really does make all the difference. It gives the edges a nice
buttery crispness. Make sure you give the oven and the pan plenty of time to
preheat. If the butter doesn't sizzle when you lube up the pan, the pan isn't
hot enough. Recipe from Alton Brown, but I've reduced the salt by 1/2 a teaspoon
from his version. by Kitchen Ninja.

## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups cornmeal
- 1 1/4 cups milk
- 1/2 cup vegetable oil
- 2 eggs
- 1 cup flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter

## Cooking Instructions

1. Place cast iron skillet in oven and preheat to 450F.
2. In large bowl, combine cornmeal and milk, then set aside. For best results,
   give it 15 minutes to soak. You need this time anyway so that the pan can get
   plenty hot.
3. In a separate bowl, combine the eggs and oil.
4. In a third (large) bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and salt.
5. Stir the eggs and oil into the cornmeal mixture. Combine thoroughly and then
   add the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Stir until the mixture just
   comes together, being careful not to over-mix.
6. Carefully remove the hot cast iron pan from the oven and rub butter onto
   bottom and sides. Pour in the batter and return the pan to the oven.
7. Bake at 450F for about 25 minutes, until the center hits 190F or a toothpick
   comes out clean.
8. Cornbread should slide out easily. Cut into wedges (this is easier when it's
   upside down) and devour.
